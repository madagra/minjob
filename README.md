## Description

*minjob* is a simple, purely Python library which allows to monitor Python threads and processes. It restarts the processes it monitors when a 
fatal exception occurs and can smoothly terminate them. Optionally, it can also send an email in the case a process has failed too many times.

This small library provides a simple way for dealing with fatal exceptions when running simple multi-thread/multi-process applications 
with high availability requirements such as market trading bots.
